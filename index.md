## **Adventure Game: The Backrooms**
  The title of my game is “The Backrooms”, this game is based on the urban legend that if you’re not careful you can “noclip” out of reality and accidentally get teleported into a realm of nothing but empty rooms that feel familiar to you. The main character has amnesia and wakes up in the backrooms. The player's mission is to escape the backrooms through their choices, the player will be presented with a set of choices that will guide them in exploring each room or will help them escape ominous entities that live in each room. If the player chooses the wrong choices they go insane and get trapped in the backrooms forever. Each room counts as a level that the player must complete to progress. As the player progresses, they regain parts of their memory and they learn why they were “noclipped” into the backrooms.

## **Tip Calculator**
I practiced making a tip calculator that allows users to enter their bill total and tip percentage and then the application calculates their bill amount.

 In my tip calculator, I added a few codes that validate the users input. For instance, I made sure that users do not enter a bill amount that's equal to or less than 0. If the user types "0" for their tip percentage I typed in a code that asks the user if they are sure that they'll tip 0% and if they choose to change their tip percentage then I implemented recursion so that the user can go back and change their tip %. After the bill amount is calculated, I added code that asks if the user wants to continue calculating or not. 
 ## **Trivia game**
 Trivia application that allows the player to guess a correct answer from a series of trivia questions
