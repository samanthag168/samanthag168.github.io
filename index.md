 The title of my game is “The Backrooms”, this game is based on the urban legend that if you’re not careful you can “noclip” out of reality and accidentally get teleported into a realm of nothing but empty rooms that feel familiar to you. The main character has amnesia and wakes up in the backrooms. The player's mission is to escape the backrooms through their choices, the player will be presented with a set of choices that will guide them in exploring each room or will help them escape ominous entities that live in each room. If the player chooses the wrong choices they go insane and get trapped in the backrooms forever. Each room counts as a level that the player must complete to progress. As the player progresses, they regain parts of their memory and they learn why they were “noclipped” into the backrooms.
