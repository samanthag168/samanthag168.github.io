## **Adventure Game: The Backrooms**
  The title of my game is “The Backrooms”, this game is based on the urban legend that if you’re not careful you can “noclip” out of reality and accidentally get teleported into a realm of nothing but empty rooms that feel familiar to you. The main character has amnesia and wakes up in the backrooms. The player's mission is to escape the backrooms through their choices, the player will be presented with a set of choices that will guide them in exploring each room or will help them escape ominous entities that live in each room. If the player chooses the wrong choices they go insane and get trapped in the backrooms forever. Each room counts as a level that the player must complete to progress. As the player progresses, they regain parts of their memory and they learn why they were “noclipped” into the backrooms.

  Initially, I had issues running my program the way I want it to but then I realized I did not create an instance of a game in the program class and in the main() method. I also created some of my own ASCII art to fit specific events in my game. For instance, I created ASCII art of the entities and document item.

## **Tip Calculator**
I practiced making a tip calculator that allows users to enter their bill total and tip percentage and then the application calculates their bill amount.

 In my tip calculator, I added a few codes that validate the users input. For instance, I made sure that users do not enter a bill amount that's equal to or less than 0. If the user types "0" for their tip percentage I typed in a code that asks the user if they are sure that they'll tip 0% and if they choose to change their tip percentage then I implemented recursion so that the user can go back and change their tip %. After the bill amount is calculated, I added code that asks if the user wants to continue calculating or not. Additionally, I figured out how to display doubles as currency and I improved my usage of if/else statements and validation of user response.

 ## **Trivia game**
 Trivia application that allows the player to guess a correct answer from a series of trivia questions

  I created this application for fun and practice. I used the code created in class as a reference and I practiced altering variables. I wanted to understand how the utility class works. I had fun adding ASCII's and now I have a better understanding of how you can program the utility class to validate user input.

 ## **Explorable Areas: Arcadia High**
  I created an explorable areas application in order to practice programming and I had fun getting creative and coming up with areas to explore, NPCs, items, etc. My game is titled "Arcadia High" which is a high school simulator type of game and the player has to attend classes and their objective is to deliver a receive to their crush.

  I created a large variety of items, such as, food items that the player can buy like a cheese pizza meal, cheeseburger meal, fruit cup, etc. I also created a few locations like "Locker" where the player will obtain most of their required items. I added currency to the game so that the player can trade money with the lunchladies to get the food items. I included prices for each food item

## **Number Guessing Game**
A game where a player guesses the number the PC is thinking of, the PC randomly generates a number between 1 and 10. 
![number3](https://github.com/samanthag168/samanthag168.github.io/blob/main/number3.png)
  I added two different codes for my game. I started off with a simple code which had the target number already assigned. The correct guess was 14 and I used if/else statements to verify if the player was correct or not. In my second code, I programmed the game so that it would generate a random number between 1 and 10 and I added a tryparse code that validates the player's input so that they'd type in a number.
